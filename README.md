# html5slides-uulm

An HTML5-based slide deck, styled in Ulm University corporate design. The slides are based on the html5slides Google I/O 2011 template (http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/).

## Examples / HowTo

Please refer to `templates/index.html` as guideline.

## Feature Improvements  (compared to original html5slides)

slides.js

- go to n-th slide via `g` key
- jump to first slide via `home` / `pos1` key
- jump to last slide via `end` key
- automatic slide enumeration (injects `<span class="slide-nr">nr</span>` onto each slide)
- substructuring and toc mechanism (use `<section
  class="structure">...</section>` blocks to partition your
  presentation)
